## Predicting Employee Churn 

### Why: 
The key to any organization's success is attracting and retaining the best people. One of the goals of HR analysts is to prevent personnel from leaving, or churn. Therefore, they would need to know the driving factors that encourage employee involvement and discourage from staying. Our model should accurately predict churn based on classification of data per employee.
In machine learning terms, we must determine which evaluation metric or score matters most i.e. accuracy, precision, or recall. 
From a business understanding, I care more about recall or 'false negative' measurement, meaning an employee decides to quit, but our model fails to predict this outcome.
